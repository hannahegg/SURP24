# SURP24
This is a collection of the sonified data audio files that I created from Red Giant stars. 

# 16CygnusA Files
Created in Week 2, the mode 2 file is a compilation of all of the mode 2 frequencies together from 16Cygnus A.
Created in Week 3, the Radv_norm is all of the normalized frequencies of mode 2. Normalized in this case means to remove the DC offset and center on 0.0 vertically. The normalized peak amplitude is -1.0 dB. 

# KIC Audio Files
These are the frequencies of certain mode 0 stars played together. They vary in evolutoinary phase:
evo 0 is the RGB (Red Giant Branch), evo 1 is the RC (Red Clump), evo 2 is the secondary clump). Files that contain fMAX in the name will have their natural frequencies added with some sort of cutting in there to hear the difference of when its tutti (played all together) vs cut out (just the mode 0 frequencies, for example).
